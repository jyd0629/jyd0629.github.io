<span>Zari leads Lily up a hill.</span>
<span>A: Look! There&#39;s a waterfall!</span>
<span>Lily is still looking at the footprints on her phone. Zari turns around to look for Lily.</span>
<span>A: Lily, you&#39;re missing everything!</span>
<span>Without looking, Zari walks into a spider web.</span>
<span>A: Ahh! I think there&#39;s a spider on my head!</span>
<span>Zari jumps up and down and waves her arms.</span>
<span>A: Help! Get this spider off me!</span>
<span>Lily runs up to Zari with her phone.</span>
<span>B: Stop moving, Zari! I&#39;m trying to help!</span>
<span>A: It might be poisonous! I&#39;m going to die!</span>
<span>Lily takes a photo of the spider, then brushes the spider off of Zari&#39;s head.</span>
<span>B: Relax. The app says it&#39;s not poisonous.</span>
<span>Lily shows Zari the picture of the spider on her phone.</span>
<span>B: Look, that spider was beautiful!</span>
<span>A: Oh, wow! I never even got to see it!</span>
<span>B: Aren&#39;t you happy I brought my phone?</span></p></blockquote></div>
