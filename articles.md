A: Well, yes, it does smell awful. And that lamp?
B: I'd prefer to sit in the dark.
A: But that TV is definitely not trash. It looks expensive.

A: Ms. Taylor won't mind.
Suddenly, Ms. Taylor enters the bathroom.
E: I found you! You all need to go to class right now.
E: But not you, Zari and Lily.
E: You need to go to the principal's office.
B: Oh no! I don't want to be in trouble!
E: Well, maybe you don't have to go to the principal's office…
A: Yes!

A: Well, maybe I don't want to grow up! I like being a kid.
C: He's right. Growing up is terrible.
C: You have to get a job and work for people you don't like.
Lily's boss walks by and tells her that she needs to speak to her alone.
D: Lily, you haven't sold anything this month. If you don't sell something today, then I'll have to fire you.
Lily walks back to Junior and Eddy.
C: Did I say growing up is terrible? I was wrong. Growing up is great.

Junior runs over to Eddy.
C: Look, Dad, the band signed my shirt!
B: That's so cool, Junior! Maybe they'll sign mine too.
A new song starts, and Junior and Eddy begin dancing again.

B: Ugh, fine.
Janet walks onto the stage, sits down, and starts crying.

A: Because I'm serious about you!
B: You are?
A: Or… you can move in with Junior and me! We can get married!
B: You want to get married?! Eddy, we've only dated for two months!
A: You're right. That's pretty soon. I was just worried…

A: Oh, yeah. I remember now.
B: It's a great game!
B: Look at all of the turtles I downloaded!
A: Junior, I think the game charges my credit card every time you download new turtles. You spent $150!

C: Fine. I'll ask my boss, but I don't think he will agree. I'll call you back.
Pamela ends the call.

Bea's friend Lin arrives at the house with several friends.
A: Lin, who are all of these people?!

B: No, they didn't!
Bea finds some supplies to fix the hole.
A: Ugh, why did I invite you here? You're not a responsible person.

A: That's so mean!
B: You were mean to me first!
Suddenly, Bea's boss walks in.
C: Excuse me. What are you doing?
A: We're so sorry!

B: Of course, Eddy!
Lucy looks at the sign.
B: It says, "Eddy for Mayor."
A: Yes, exactly!
B: Why do you want to be the mayor of our city?
A: Because I don't think politicians listen to regular people like us!
B: But Eddy, you don't like politics.
A: No, but I like people!
A: And a good mayor should care about people.
B: Yes, that's true. But a mayor also needs to know about town rules, and government, and laws.
A: Actually, Junior is studying politics. He told me that a lot of politicians don't know the laws at all!
B: I don't think this is a good idea.
A: Why not?
B: Eddy, I go to every city meeting, and I've never seen you there.
A: Oh, I hate meetings.
B: Eddy, trust me. It's a really hard job.
B: You'll have to go to lots of meetings and talk to politicians all the time.
A: Ugh, I do not like politicians. I need someone to help me do that stuff.
A: Hey, you should be my campaign manager!
B: Me?
A: Yes! You know everyone, you care about the city, and you have great ideas!

They sit down on a towel and take out the sandwiches.

B: What is that?
A: It's my motorcycle!
B: I thought that you were going to rent a car.
A: Renting a car is very expensive, but riding my motorcycle is free.
A: Now get on.
B: You want me to ride on the back of your motorcycle?
A: What's wrong? Are you scared?
B: I'm not scared of anything.
B: Except for hairless cats.
A: If you're not scared, then let's go.
B: OK, but I'm driving.
A: You want to drive my motorcycle?
B: Of course.
A: Bea! Why do you always have to control everything?
A: Why can't you relax?
B: I will relax… when you let me drive.
B: Lin, do you want to go to the beach or not?
A: Yes, I do.
Later, Bea is driving the motorcycle, and Lin is riding behind her.

B: Where are you going?
A: I have a date tonight!
B: Did you meet him on the Internet?
A: Actually, I have known him for fifty years.

B: Wait… are you nervous? I can't believe it!
A: I'm not nervous! Do I look nervous?
B: A little, yes. Why are you nervous?!
A: Well… so much has changed in fifty years!
B: I know! The Internet, cell phones, frozen yogurt—

# 167. Move the Bed
> Zari is lying on Lily's bed. She's looking up at the ceiling.
A: Lily, your room is boring. You should move your furniture.
B: No. The room looks good now.
A: I think your bed would look great in that corner.
B: I do not.
A: You know, it's really dangerous to have your bed next to the window.
B: Dangerous?
A: Lightning could hit that tree outside, and it could fall through your window.
A: Or a murderer could climb into your room!
B: Wow, Zari. You've thought a lot about this.
A: I'm trying to be a good friend, Lily. I want you to be safe.
B: I'm fine. My bed has always been next to the window.
A: Always? Then don't you want to try something new?
B: You know I hate new things.
A: Well… I read a book once that said it's good to sleep with your head on the north side of your room.
B: This is the north side of my room.
A: Oh, did I say north side? I mean south side.
B: Ugh, Zari! Why do you want me to move my bed?
A: I think it will look so nice!
B: Fine. Help me move it.

A: Question four: How many hours do you sleep every night?
B: I usually sleep for ten hours. But if I go dancing, I only sleep for eight hours.
A: Eight hours?!
A: Question five: Do you feel stressed?
B: Only when my granddaughter asks too many questions!
A: But Grandma, you're getting older!

A: Eddy, yogurt is not dinner.
B: I also have… cereal?
A: Eddy, cereal is not dinner! Where are all the vegetables?

B: Actually, I think that's Junior's science experiment.
A: You should go to the supermarket.
B: She'll be here in thirty minutes!
B: I don't have time to go to the supermarket!
Junior walks into the kitchen.
C: Hi, Vikram. Hi, Dad.
C: What's wrong?
A: He's worried because his date is a vegetarian.
C: So?
B: We don't have any food to make a vegetarian dinner!

A: Oh no! Maybe I can fix it!
He picks up the pieces of the vase.
A: This piece goes here… this piece goes there… oh no. This looks terrible.
His wife, Priti, walks into the room. Vikram tries to hide the vase.
B: Vikram! Did you break that vase?
B: Were you dancing again?
A: Yes. But don't worry! I can fix it! Look!
Vikram shows her pieces of the vase.
B: Oh, honey. I don't think we can fix it.
A: I know, I'm so sorry. I know it was your favorite.
B: My favorite?
A: Yes. Because it was a wedding present from your sister.
B: She didn't give us this vase. She gave us a picture frame.
A: Oh, right! Did your mother give us the vase?
B: No, she gave us that clock you broke last month, when you were doing yoga.
A: Oh, right.
B: Maybe it's from your cousin.
A: But the vase is so ugly!
B: I know. That's why I thought your cousin gave it to us.
A: Ha! Wait, you also think the vase is ugly?

A: What? Why not?
B: I forgot our anniversary last year, and I think he's still angry about it. He's very late.
A: But that was a year ago!
A: He's probably late because of traffic.
B: No, he's not coming…
B: And look at everything I did for him this year. I got his favorite flowers.
B: And I hired a musician to play his favorite song.
Julia points to a violin player at a nearby table.

B: He was so angry when I forgot our anniversary last year.
B: This year, I remembered everything. But he's not here! Now I know our relationship is finished.

Julia gets a text message.
B: Oh, George just texted me!
B: He says, "I'm so excited for our anniversary tomorrow."

A: I'm going to be in the play! After you fainted, I wasn't nervous anymore! My audition was great!
A: And you're going to be in the play too!

A: Next time, I'll remember that you like ties.
B: Let's hurry. I only have twenty minutes.
A: Only twenty minutes?!
B: That should be enough time.
A: You're right. My parents were in love the first minute they saw each other!
B: Interesting. So, tell me about your job.
A: I teach gym at the high school.
B: You must be good with kids.
A: I should tell you… I have an eight-year-old son.
B: That's OK!
A: Really? I'm so glad you said that! Maybe I can introduce you to him…
B: I don't think that's necessary.
B: Tell me about your skills.
A: I'm very good at making romantic dinners.
B: No, I want to know about your job skills.
A: Do you always talk about work so much on a first date?
B: This isn't a date. It's a job interview.
Eddy looks at his phone.
A: Oh no! This is the wrong appointment. I thought you were my date. You're—
B: I'm Liz, from the gym downtown. We are hiring a manager to work at night and on weekends.

# 186. Nice Tie
> Zari is babysitting Junior while his dad is on a date.
Junior walks into the room. He's wearing a nice shirt and a tie.
A: Junior, why are you wearing a tie?
B: Sometimes I wear ties. I like to look fancy.
A: Aw, that's great. You look nice!
B: So… are you inviting a friend here?
A: No, why?
B: Well… the last time you babysat me, Lily came over.
A: Oh, do you want me to invite Lily?
B: I mean, sure, only if you want to…
Junior brings a huge plate of cheese and fruit from the kitchen.
B: And if she comes over, we have plenty of juice and snacks for her!
A: Wow, Junior! Did you make that by yourself?
B: It was easy.
A: Junior, do you like Lily?
B: No. She's pretty cool, but…
A: You know, I can ask Lily if she wants to babysit you sometime.
B: What? Really? Do you think she'll say yes?
A: If your dad is paying her, then she'll say yes.
Suddenly, there's a knock on the door.
B: Who's that?!
A: I think it's Lily!
B: Did you invite her?!
A: She's just bringing me my homework.
Zari walks to the door.

B: I need to go to bed now!
Junior runs into his bedroom and closes the door.

B: I had an accident yesterday.
A: An accident? What happened?
B: Well, I woke up in the morning and made tea.
B: And I dropped the pot of hot water.
A: Did you burn your foot?
B: No, but the water spilled on the floor and the pot broke.
A: Oh.
B: After that, I had to buy a new pot, so I got on my motorcycle. While I was riding, a cow walked into the road!
A: Oh no! Did you hit the cow? Is that how you hurt your foot?
B: No, but I had to stop very quickly. I fell off my motorcycle!
A: Oh, so that's how you hurt your foot!
B: No. After I fell, my motorcycle wasn't working, so I walked to find help.
B: And then a huge dog started running towards me.
A: Did the dog bite you?
B: No, he was very friendly!
A: OK…
B: Then a nice man saw me on the road and stopped to help me.
B: He was very handsome, so I asked him to go out with me.
A: But how did you hurt your foot?!
B: He stepped on it! I'll never go dancing with him again.

Lucy runs over to them.
B: Oh, hi, Lucy… It's good to see you but sorry, we need to go sit down.
A: Movies never start on time.
A:  Stay for a minute.
C: Sure!
B: Uh… sure.
A: It's been a long time! How have you been?
B: Uh… fine. And you?
A: I'm good! I just started boxing, and I love it!
Lucy turns to the woman and smiles.
A: And you look great! Did you change your hair color? You look so good with blonde hair!
C: No, this is the color my hair has always been.
A: Really? And you stopped wearing glasses! It makes you look so much younger.
C: I've never worn glasses…
B: We really need to leave for that movie…
A: Actually, you look a lot younger now! What is your secret?
C: I'm sorry, but we've never met before.
A: What? Of course we've met. I was a guest at your wedding.
C: What wedding? John and I aren't married.
A: That's funny, Sandra.
C: My name is Shirley! Who's Sandra?!
B: Oh hey! The movie is starting now! We have to go!

> Junior and Lily are at a museum.
A: This museum is pretty cool…
B: It's a really great museum! And this is a great date!
A: What? Junior, this is not a date.
B: But it's just the two of us. Alone!
A: That doesn't mean it's a date.
A: We went to the library together on Wednesday, and that wasn't a date.
B: Wait… that wasn't a date either?
A: No, Junior! I'm your babysitter, not your date.
B: Well, I'm confused. What usually happens during a date?
A: Well, uh… A date happens at a place like… a restaurant.
B: But we went to a sandwich shop for lunch!
A: No, not a sandwich shop. A fancy restaurant.
B: But you bought my sandwich…
A: Your dad gave me the money for your sandwich.
A: It's also the afternoon right now. Dates don't happen during the day.
A week later, Junior sees Lily at the movie theater.
B: Hi Lily! You're seeing this movie too?
A: Oh, hi, Junior.
B: Wow, that's a lot of popcorn for one person!
A: OK, you can sit next to me and eat some of my popcorn.
A: But no talking. And remember—
B: I know, I know. It's not a date!
B: Anyway, I already have a date tonight.
Zari walks over to Junior and Lily. She has two sodas and a box of candy.

Oscar continues to wait. Then, the security guard waves at a man in a leather jacket. He lets the man inside the building.
A: Hey! I was here before that man!
B: Yeah. But he's cool. Look at what he's wearing.
Oscar gets an idea. He runs into a store nearby and buys a new jacket. He walks over to the security guard again.
A: Now will you let me in?
The security guard looks at Oscar wearing his new jacket.
B: That's a great jacket. But no, you still can't go in.
The security guard lets a man and a woman go into the building.
A: Those people just got here!
B: It's cold. I didn't want them to wait outside for a long time.
A: I'm cold! I've been waiting outside for hours!
B: But now you have a warm jacket.
A: Ugh!

A: Ugh, fine.
Oscar sees his friend Lucy and waves at her.
A: Hey, Lucy! You're here for the art show too?! I've been waiting in line for hours.

A: It should be in a magazine!
B: Thank you. It was in a magazine last year.
A: I love your gold bathroom mirror ! And your towels are so white!
B: Yes, and very expensive.
A: Wow, this vase is nice, too! Putting flowers on top of the toilet is a great idea.
B: Eddy, are you going to fix the sink?
A: Oh! Yes, of course.
Eddy walks towards the sink. He accidentally hits the vase. It falls on the floor and breaks.
A: Oh no! Sorry…
B: It's OK. Just fix the sink, please.
Eddy starts to fix the sink. Water spills on the floor. Eddy grabs a towel.
B: No! Eddy!
B: Don't use my expensive towels!
Eddy stands up quickly and hits the mirror. It falls off the wall and breaks.
A: Oops.
B: My new mirror!
A: OK… I'm finished. Look! I fixed the sink!

D: She's over there.
B: Come on, Zari. Let's go talk to Hannah. And stop being jealous.
A: I'm not jealous. It's OK that you like Hannah more than you like me…
B: Zari…
They walk over to Hannah.
E: Lily! I'm surprised to see you. Don't you hate parties?
A: She does hate parties, but she really wanted to see you.
E: Really?
A: Yes, because Lily's your best friend, right?
E: Uh… no.
A: Then why are you here, Lily?

B: Oh. Then, what is the problem?
A: We need to talk about Junior's homework.
B: Ah. I understand.

A: Well, this week—
B: Actually, this week I helped him with his science project!
A: Oh, you helped him with his project?
B: Yes! I helped him because I know a lot about dinosaurs.
A: You do?
B: Yes. I've seen every dinosaur movie.
A: Ah. Well, Junior's homework is usually very good…
B: That's great!
A: But his dinosaur project was terrible.
A: A lot of the information was wrong.
A: For example, humans did not ride dinosaurs.
B: Oh… right, I knew that.
A: Also, dinosaurs could not run faster than cars.
B: Really?
A: Maybe you should let Junior do the research next time.

B: I know.
A: We need to have a serious conversation.
B: Alright.
A: There's always a mess in the store when you're working.
B: If I clean the store, the customers make it messy again, so I just wait until the end of the day to clean. 
A: But you never clean the store at the end of the day.
B: That's true. 
A: And the music you play is too loud.
B: I play loud music so the customers can't talk to me.
A: That's another thing. You are so mean to the customers!

C: Haha, you're so funny. Bye!

A: You'll have to make the work schedule for all the employees.

A: But you will make more money.

B: If a cat is sleeping on your lap, you can't stand up to do anything.
A: Hmm. I've never heard of the Cat Rule…
B: So, Dad, can you bring me a drink?
A: Can't you get it yourself?

B: I can't do anything until the cat wakes up!
Eddy tries to move the cat.
A: Hey, cat—
B: Don't wake the cat up on purpose, Dad! That's mean!

B: He had a busy day.
Someone knocks on the door.
A: Do you want to answer the door? Oh right, you can't. Cat Rule, right?

A: Will the shot hurt?
B: It might hurt for a second, so you have to be very brave!

A: That's right. He fights dragons!
B: Exactly!
A: OK. I'm going to be brave. I'm not going to scream or cry.
There is a knock on the door. It's the doctor.

A: Doctor, I don't think I can do this!
C: OK, Junior… I'll give your dad a flu shot first, so you can see it's very safe.
B: What? I'm getting a flu shot?
C: Why not?
B: Because this appointment is for Junior, not for me.
C: You should get a flu shot too.
A: What's wrong, Dad? You don't look very good.

A: I see. Then, what is something that helps you feel calm?
B: I don't ever feel calm.
The therapist smiles patiently.
A: You could try to meditate.
B: No. I don't have time to sit and do nothing!
A: Maybe you need something more active. Have you tried yoga?
B: Yes. But I hate the music yoga teachers play. And anyway, I can't touch my toes!
The therapist takes a deep breath.
A: You could take a long, hot bath to relax…
B: By the time I relax, the water is always cold!
A: OK. Try to stay calm. Inhale, exhale.
Oscar's therapist tries one more suggestion.
A: You could go to the beach.

B: Not me! The last time I went to the beach, I got a sunburn and all of my students called me "Mr. Tomato!"
B: I hate being called Mr. Tomato!
A: Oscar! You're shouting again!
She puts her notebook down.
A: I think I know something that will help you feel more relaxed.

A: But I need to be on this flight!
B: Sorry. Those are the rules.
A: Ugh! I can't miss this wedding!

A: If I can't check a bag, then I won't check a bag.
B: Finally, you understand.
Bea opens up her suitcase.
B: Excuse me, ma'am?
Bea puts on a swimsuit over her outfit. Then she puts on another one.

C: The fur industry is cruel! Take off that coat, or I'm going to throw this paint on you.
B: This coat is vintage! It was my uncle's! I didn't hurt any animals!
C: Yes, but your uncle did. Take it off.
B: It's cold right now! And this is the warmest coat I have!
C: You want to hurt animals so you can be warm and stylish?
Oscar turns to Paul.
B: See, Paul? I told you this coat was stylish.
C: I know you're my art teacher, but I have to do this.
Lily holds up the bucket of paint.
B: Wait!
B: My coat isn't real fur.
C: It isn't?
A: Why didn't you just say that?
B: I wanted everyone to think I was wearing an expensive fur coat.

When Junior gets home from school, his father is waiting for him.
A: Is something wrong, Dad?
B: Yes. I was late for work today because I spent the morning cleaning windows.
A: Are you starting a window cleaning business too?

A: I want Maggie to come too!
B: The last time we went to a concert with her, she sang louder than the band!
A: Lily, don't be mean. Why hasn't Maggie texted me back? Is she mad at me?
B: Why would anyone be mad at you?
A: Maybe it's because we wore the same sweater yesterday.
B: Even I have that sweater.
A: Or maybe it's because I got a better grade than her in math class?
B: You get better grades than everybody.

Zari stands up and nervously waves at Maggie. Maggie looks away.

Eddy's phone beeps twelve more times.
B: Whoa! You have a lot of matches.
The next morning, Bea comes over to Eddy's apartment.
B: Good morning, neighbor! I brought you coffee!

B: Are you talking to one of your matches on the app?
A: Yes… well, I'm talking to… a few of them.
B: Wait, are you wearing the same clothes from yesterday? You look exhausted!
A: I've been awake all night!

# 238. I Can Predict the Future
> Bea and Lin are walking down the street.
A: Do you want to go get a drink?
B: I can't. I have to go home and finish a presentation for a client.
A: No, you don't!
B: Yes, I do, I have a meeting with this client tomorrow.
A: Trust me, you don't have to worry about that meeting.
B: How could you possibly know that?
A: Well, because I can predict the future. I'm a psychic.
B: Is that a joke?
A: No! Seriously, I predict the future all the time.
B: Prove it.
A: You see that dog over there? He's going to stop and smell that tree.
Lin points to a dog, who then smells a tree.
B: That was easy! That's what all dog do.
Just then, Bea gets a text.
A: That's Joe. He wants to go on a date.
Bea checks her phone and sees that Lin is right.
B: Lucky guess. I told you yesterday that he likes me.
A: Don't be jealous because you're not a psychic like me.
B: Lin, look out!
Suddenly a truck drives by, splashing Lin with water.
A: Oh no! My clothes are soaked! We can't go to the bar now!
B: Hahahaha! You said you can predict the future. Why didn't you know that was going to happen?
A: Wow. Maybe I'm not a psychic…
Just then, Bea gets a call from her boss. She looks really disappointed.
A: Are you OK?
B: No. My meeting tomorrow is canceled. That client just fired our company.
A: Oh no! I'm sorry.
B: I spent so much time on that presentation!
A: Well, I did say that you had nothing to worry about…
B: Maybe you can predict the future after all.

> Eddy and Junior walk into a big, dark house full of dusty, old furniture.
A: Come on, Junior! I can't wait to show you this house.
B: This house is scary!
A: No, it's not. I came here a lot when I was little.
A: Anyway, it's our house now! When Uncle Edward died, he left it to us.
A: Although I always thought he hated me…
B: Dad, are we moving here?
A: Of course! It's much bigger than our apartment.
B: But I love our apartment. This house looks dirty.
A: It's just dark. Turn on the lights.
Junior tries to turn on a light. Sparks come out of the wall.
A: We'll fix that.
They walk into a dining room with an enormous chandelier. Eddy touches it.
A: I've always wanted a chandelier…
B: Dad, look out!
The chandelier falls and almost hits Eddy.
A: Whoops. Wow, it's not broken!
A: Hey, look at that amazing wallpaper.
Junior looks closely at a wall covered in dark spots.
B: That's mold.
They go into a bedroom upstairs. There's a hole in the roof. Birds are flying in and out.
B: We can't sleep here!
A: You've always wanted a pet bird, right?
Eddy and Junior walk into a bathroom.
A: This is my favorite thing in the house!
Eddy jumps into the bathtub.
The floor breaks. Eddy and the bathtub fall down into the room below.
Junior shouts down to Eddy.
B: Dad! Are you OK?
A: I'm fine!
B: Dad, this house is really dangerous!

# 240. Get Out!
> Lin and Lucy are walking down the street when it starts to rain.
A: Let's go to a coffee shop to get out of the rain. How about this one?

They continue walking.
A: Oh, this one looks good!
B: We can't go there either.
A: What about the one next door?
B: Definitely not.
A: What's wrong with all these coffee shops?
B: Well… I'm not allowed to go inside any of them.
A: Are you serious? We're getting really wet.
Frustrated, Lin walks into the closest coffee shop. Lucy follows her.
C: Get out of here, Lucy!
They quickly leave.
B: He's mad because I illegally downloaded movies using the café's wifi connection.
A: OK, let's go to the restaurant next door.
They walk in, and the waiter bursts into tears.
D: Lucy! How could you come here after you broke my heart?!
B: Sorry, François. I've got to run!
They rush out of the restaurant.
A: What about this bakery?
The owner at the bakery looks at Lucy angrily.
B: Hi Ron…
E: Get out!
B: Sorry I took all your money in that poker game. We'll leave.
A: You're making it impossible for us to get out of the rain in this neighborhood!
B: Oh! There's a deli across the street.
A: And you're still allowed in there?
B: Yes! The owner loves me. I taught him all about cryptocurrency. He'll give us free coffee.
A: Great!
Later, after the rain stops, they walk to the park with their coffees.
A: Why don't we sit there, next to the violin player?
The violin player sees Lucy.
F: Hey! I told you I never wanted to see you here again!
A: What did you do to that guy?!
B: Don't ask.
# 241. Late Fees
> Lily is standing at the librarian's desk in the library. She's trying to check out a book.
A: I'm sorry, I can't let you check out this book. Your library card has been suspended.
B: What?! My library card can't be suspended!
The librarian points to a sign that says, "Quiet, please!"
B: But I need this book for a school assignment.
A: I'm sorry. You've checked out several books and you haven't returned them.
B: What?! That's not possible.
A: Shhh!
The librarian points to the "Quiet, please!" sign again.
A: It's a rule that I take very seriously.
A: According to our records, you haven't returned "The History of Unicorns", "Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume One", and "Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume Two."
B: I would never read any of those books. There must be something wrong with your computer.
A: I'm sorry, but I can't let you check out another book until you return those books and then pay the late fees.
B: Fine! I'll do my research on the Internet!
Lily angrily walks away. Just then, she notices Zari in the library. She's reading volume two of "Teenage Vampires In Love."
Lily grabs the book from Zari.
B: Zari! Have you been checking out books with my library card?!
C: I'm sorry! But you know how much I love reading!
B: Why didn't you use your library card!?
C: Because… they took it away. I always returned my books late, so I had a lot of late fees.
B: Argh!
C: Can you ever forgive me?
B: Ahhh. I guess so.
C: Great. Because I need you to check out "Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume Three"!
# 242. Painting at Sunrise
> Lin is painting in Oscar's studio.
A: Ugh… My painting is boring.
B: Well, sometimes you just need inspiration… and great light.
Oscar points outside.
B: There's an amazing view from the mountain. Go there at sunrise.
A: Sunrise?! I hate waking up early!
B: You have to. The light at sunrise is perfect.
A: I hope the view is worth it.
The next morning, Lin hikes up the mountain with her paint, canvas, and easel.
She meets a hiker on the trail.
C: Wow, that looks heavy! How far are you hiking?
A: I'm going to the top of the mountain.
C: That's three miles!
A: What?!
Two hours later, Lin arrives at the top and sets up her easel.
A: Ugh, I'm exhausted. But the light here is perfect!
As she picks up her paintbrush, a family sets up a picnic in front of her.
A: Excuse me! I'm trying to paint.
D: Oh, we'll only be here for a few minutes! Would you like a sandwich?
A: No, thanks. I need to paint before the sunrise is over.
Lin moves her easel to a new place. Just then, a bus full of tourists arrives.
A: Hey! I'm trying to paint! Can you move?
E: Sure, as soon as we get some pictures!
The tourists all begin to take pictures.
A: Ugh! The sunrise is gone!
Lin angrily throws her brushes at the canvas.
A: I quit!
Lin hikes back down the mountain and returns to Oscar's studio.
A: Here's your easel, Oscar.
B: How did your painting go this morning?
A: Not good.
Lin shows Oscar the painting.

Vikram calls her at her office.
A: Hi, Vikram! Am I late for lunch?
B: It's actually dinner time.
A: Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.
B: You've been working so much that we haven't spent any time together…
A: I know, I'm sorry.
B: That's why I've planned a surprise weekend trip!
A: Ah! That's just what I need.
The next morning, Vikram drives Priti to the countryside.
B: This isn't a regular hotel. It's a unique experience!
They go to the front desk.
C: Welcome, here are the keys to your barn.
A: Barn?!
B: We've never slept in a barn!
A: Yes, because we're not horses.
C: You'll love it! Would you like some water?
A: That would be great!
The receptionist hands Priti a bucket.
C: The well is at the top of the hill.
A: There's no faucet in the barn? I'm not walking up that hill.
B: But the water will be so fresh!
A: I'm too tired. I just want to go to sleep and wake up late tomorrow.
The next day, a rooster wakes them up at five in the morning.
The receptionist knocks on their door.
C: Time to go! You don't want to be late.
A: For what?
C: For collecting eggs from our chickens to make breakfast!
B: Ooh… you love fresh eggs, honey. Right?
Next, Vikram and Priti have to milk a cow to get cream for coffee.
A: Vikram, this is exhausting!
B: I'm sorry. This is the opposite of a relaxing vacation.
A: But on the other hand, I haven't thought about my stressful job in hours.
B: So, should we stay another night?
A: Absolutely not.
# 244. Nature Hike
> Zari and Lily are hiking through the forest. Lily keeps looking at her phone.

A: It's not dangerous. It's beautiful. Look around you!
B: I only see danger.
Lily takes a photo of a plant with her phone.
B: My app says this plant is poisonous. Don't eat it.
A: I'm not going to eat random plants, Lily.
Lily and Zari keep walking.
A: These trees are amazing.
B: Falling trees kill over one hundred people every year.
A: Look at these footprints! Cool!
B: It might be a wolf…
A: I'm pretty sure they're duck footprints.
Lily takes a photo with her phone.
B: The app says they're duck footprints.
A: That's what I just said.
Zari leads Lily up a hill.
A: Look! There's a waterfall!
Lily is still looking at the footprints on her phone. Zari turns around to look for Lily.
A: Lily, you're missing everything!
Without looking, Zari walks into a spider web.
A: Ahh! I think there's a spider on my head!
Zari jumps up and down and waves her arms.
A: Help! Get this spider off me!
Lily runs up to Zari with her phone.
B: Stop moving, Zari! I'm trying to help!
A: It might be poisonous! I'm going to die!
Lily takes a photo of the spider, then brushes the spider off of Zari's head.
B: Relax. The app says it's not poisonous.
Lily shows Zari the picture of the spider on her phone.
B: Look, that spider was beautiful!
A: Oh, wow! I never even got to see it!
B: Aren't you happy I brought my phone?
