<span>The floor breaks. Eddy and the bathtub fall down into the room below.</span>
<span>Junior shouts down to Eddy.</span>
<span>B: Dad! Are you OK?</span>
<span>A: I&#39;m fine!</span>
<span>B: Dad, this house is really dangerous!</span>
<span>A: Yeah. Now I know why Uncle Edward left it to me.</span>
<span>Eddy and Junior drive home with the chandelier in their car.</span>
<span>A: Well, at least we got a new chandelier.</span></p></blockquote><h2><a name="240-get-out" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>240. Get Out!</span></h2><blockquote><p><span>Lin and Lucy are walking down the street when it starts to rain.</span>
<span>A: Let&#39;s go to a coffee shop to get out of the rain. How about this one?</span>
<span>B: Oh, not that one.</span>
<span>They continue walking.</span>
<span>A: Oh, this one looks good!</span>
<span>B: We can&#39;t go there either.</span>
<span>A: What about the one next door?</span>
<span>B: Definitely not.</span>
<span>A: What&#39;s wrong with all these coffee shops?</span>
<span>B: Well… I&#39;m not allowed to go inside any of them.</span>
<span>A: Are you serious? We&#39;re getting really wet.</span>
<span>Frustrated, Lin walks into the closest coffee shop. Lucy follows her.</span>
<span>C: Get out of here, Lucy!</span>
<span>They quickly leave.</span>
<span>B: He&#39;s mad because I illegally downloaded movies using the café&#39;s wifi connection.</span>
<span>A: OK, let&#39;s go to the restaurant next door.</span>
<span>They walk in, and the waiter bursts into tears.</span>
<span>D: Lucy! How could you come here after you broke my heart?!</span>
<span>B: Sorry, François. I&#39;ve got to run!</span>
<span>They rush out of the restaurant.</span>
<span>A: What about this bakery?</span>
<span>The owner at the bakery looks at Lucy angrily.</span>
<span>B: Hi Ron…</span>
<span>E: Get out!</span>
<span>B: Sorry I took all your money in that poker game. We&#39;ll leave.</span>
<span>A: You&#39;re making it impossible for us to get out of the rain in this neighborhood!</span>
<span>B: Oh! There&#39;s a deli across the street.</span>
<span>A: And you&#39;re still allowed in there?</span>
<span>B: Yes! The owner loves me. I taught him all about cryptocurrency. He&#39;ll give us free coffee.</span>
<span>A: Great!</span>
<span>Later, after the rain stops, they walk to the park with their coffees.</span>
<span>A: Why don&#39;t we sit there, next to the violin player?</span>
<span>The violin player sees Lucy.</span>
<span>F: Hey! I told you I never wanted to see you here again!</span>
<span>A: What did you do to that guy?!</span>
<span>B: Don&#39;t ask.</span></p></blockquote><h2><a name="241-late-fees" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>241. Late Fees</span></h2><blockquote><p><span>Lily is standing at the librarian&#39;s desk in the library. She&#39;s trying to check out a book.</span>
<span>A: I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t let you check out this book. Your library card has been suspended.</span>
<span>B: What?! My library card can&#39;t be suspended!</span>
<span>The librarian points to a sign that says, &quot;Quiet, please!&quot;</span>
<span>B: But I need this book for a school assignment.</span>
<span>A: I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;ve checked out several books and you haven&#39;t returned them.</span>
<span>B: What?! That&#39;s not possible.</span>
<span>A: Shhh!</span>
<span>The librarian points to the &quot;Quiet, please!&quot; sign again.</span>
<span>A: It&#39;s a rule that I take very seriously.</span>
<span>A: According to our records, you haven&#39;t returned &quot;The History of Unicorns&quot;, &quot;Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume One&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume Two.&quot;</span>
<span>B: I would never read any of those books. There must be something wrong with your computer.</span>
<span>A: I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t let you check out another book until you return those books and then pay the late fees.</span>
<span>B: Fine! I&#39;ll do my research on the Internet!</span>
<span>Lily angrily walks away. Just then, she notices Zari in the library. She&#39;s reading volume two of &quot;Teenage Vampires In Love.&quot;</span>
<span>Lily grabs the book from Zari.</span>
<span>B: Zari! Have you been checking out books with my library card?!</span>
<span>C: I&#39;m sorry! But you know how much I love reading!</span>
<span>B: Why didn&#39;t you use your library card!?</span>
<span>C: Because… they took it away. I always returned my books late, so I had a lot of late fees.</span>
<span>B: Argh!</span>
<span>C: Can you ever forgive me?</span>
<span>B: Ahhh. I guess so.</span>
<span>C: Great. Because I need you to check out &quot;Teenage Vampires In Love, Volume Three&quot;!</span></p></blockquote><h2><a name="242-painting-at-sunrise" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>242. Painting at Sunrise</span></h2><blockquote><p><span>Lin is painting in Oscar&#39;s studio.</span>

<span>B: There&#39;s an amazing view from the mountain. Go there at sunrise.</span>
<span>A: Sunrise?! I hate waking up early!</span>
<span>B: You have to. The light at sunrise is perfect.</span>

<span>Two hours later, Lin arrives at the top and sets up her easel.</span>
<span>A: Ugh, I&#39;m exhausted. But the light here is perfect!</span>
<span>As she picks up her paintbrush, a family sets up a picnic in front of her.</span>
<span>A: Excuse me! I&#39;m trying to paint.</span>
<span>D: Oh, we&#39;ll only be here for a few minutes! Would you like a sandwich?</span>
<span>A: No, thanks. I need to paint before the sunrise is over.</span>
<span>Lin moves her easel to a new place. Just then, a bus full of tourists arrives.</span>
<span>A: Hey! I&#39;m trying to paint! Can you move?</span>
<span>E: Sure, as soon as we get some pictures!</span>
<span>The tourists all begin to take pictures.</span>
<span>A: Ugh! The sunrise is gone!</span>
<span>Lin angrily throws her brushes at the canvas.</span>
<span>A: I quit!</span>
<span>Lin hikes back down the mountain and returns to Oscar&#39;s studio.</span>
<span>A: Here&#39;s your easel, Oscar.</span>
<span>B: How did your painting go this morning?</span>
<span>A: Not good.</span>

<span>B: It&#39;s actually dinner time.</span>
<span>A: Oh, I didn&#39;t realize it was so late.</span>
<span>B: You&#39;ve been working so much that we haven&#39;t spent any time together…</span>
<span>A: I know, I&#39;m sorry.</span>
<span>B: That&#39;s why I&#39;ve planned a surprise weekend trip!</span>
<span>A: Ah! That&#39;s just what I need.</span>
<span>The next morning, Vikram drives Priti to the countryside.</span>
<span>B: This isn&#39;t a regular hotel. It&#39;s a unique experience!</span>
<span>They go to the front desk.</span>
<span>C: Welcome, here are the keys to your barn.</span>
<span>A: Barn?!</span>
<span>B: We&#39;ve never slept in a barn!</span>
<span>A: Yes, because we&#39;re not horses.</span>
<span>C: You&#39;ll love it! Would you like some water?</span>
<span>A: That would be great!</span>
<span>The receptionist hands Priti a bucket.</span>
